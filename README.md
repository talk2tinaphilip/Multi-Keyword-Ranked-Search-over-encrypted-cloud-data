# Multi-Keyword-Ranked-Search-over-encrypted-cloud-data
Development in cloud computing encouraged the data owners to outsource their
complex data management systems from their local sites to public cloud for economic
savings and easy maintenance. However, as the cloud customers and the cloud server are
not in the same trusted domain, the outsourced data may be under the exposure to the risk.
Corresponding data owners lose direct control of these data once the sensitive data are
outsourced to a remote cloud. Consequently, sensitive data such as emails, personal health
records, financial transactions and government confidential files has to be encrypted before
outsourcing for preserving data privacy against CSP. In chapter I of this paper, we provide
a general introduction about the data privacy and encryption as well as multi keyword
ranked search over encrypted cloud (MRSE) data. We include the architecture the efficient
similarity measures of “coordinate matching”, “inner product similarity” used in rank
retrieval. Chapter II defines a system model and a corresponding threat model. Chapter III
illustrates the privacy requirements for MRSE framework. In Chapter IV, the proposed
MRSE schemes based on the similarity measure of “coordinate matching” and secure inner
computation while meeting different privacy requirements in two different threat models
would be discussed [1]. In Chapter V, we will discuss the benefits and in Chapter VI,
current industrial practice. Chapter VII explains related works. Finally, we conclude in
chapter VIII.
